      <h1>Welcome To Adam's About Me Page!</h1>

      <p>My name is Adam. I am 30 years old. I was born in a hospital in Puyallup but actually I was raised in the great city of Olympia, Washington. When I was really young I was in preschool. This is like many years ago. While I was in preschool I learned how to write my address. Is that impressive for a preschooler? Then I graduated preschool. There wasn't a graduation party, which I suppose in retrospect is sad because you only graduate preschool once. (Unless your name is Craig.)</p>
      <p>
      After escaping the clutches of preschool I went to kindergarten at Montessori school. I know, private school kid right here. Actually it's just because the school levy failed that year and my parents were good parents and wanted me to have a good kindergarten edu-ma-cation. I read easy to read books and moved beads to learn basic multiplication. I remember the first day of kindergarten I learned what a vowel was.</p>
      <p>
      Anyways... after much sharpening of rocks and worrying the sky was falling I went to elementary school. (And yes Montessori had a proper kindergarten graduation thank you very much.) Olympic View Elementary was a good elementary school and I liked it a lot. I made some great friends there and ran around a lot. In sixth grade though I was eligible to try a new, super cool, super nerdy, experimental, all day all year special learning program called T.A.G. which replaced P.A.C.E. and I think the a's stood for achievement but don't quote me on that. In any case starting on day 1 in sixth grade I took a new special bus to Pleasant Glade Elementary. It was good. It was a lot of work. But was it worth it? Maybe? We did like, cool projects and stuff but I don't know if it was anything that special in the long run. Like you don't have a vastly different middle school or high school experience as a result except for the fact that your only friends are the fellow nerds. That sounds saltier that it should sound.</p>
      <p>
      Middle school was really really good. I guess from my perspective it was, and if awkward TV and movies prove, middle school should have been hell, so my 'good' is relatively spectacular. I met some of my best friends in my entire life at Chinook Middle School. We're still friends today.</p>
      <p>
      The first 3 years of high school proper sucked. Because my parents made me go to River Ridge High School, and through an odd fluke of the school map, my address meant I went to Chinook -> River Ridge; when basically everyone else at Chinook (except other kids in my neighborhood) went to North Thurston High School. So all those friends I made?? smdh. In any case those friends and I started a band, I was the bass player; and everyone else at any other school could have gone and &^%*ed themselves for all I cared at that point. I grew out my hair, yada yada, wore emo clothes, went to hardcore shows in downtown Oly... pretty normal stuff. Finally in my senior year I bought a car and my parents let me drive to North Thurston everyday for school. Easy peasy. Don't give up on your 14 year old dream kids. Senior year was good but I basically still hung out with the same people anyways and continued to grow my hair out.</p>
      <p>
      College at UW was great. I don't remember any single solitary minute of it that I will admit to. Nope seriously nothing to see here. </p>
      <p>
      Law school at McGeorge was bad. I lost a lot of weight. I gave myself mental health problems. I was anxious, depressed, and in denial. So I quit! After getting a C+ average. At least I passed all of my classes. And actually I really did like contracts class. I got a B+ there. Hey that's still something. And I can quite honestly say that I was in the top 75% of my 1L class.</p>
